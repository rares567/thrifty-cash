# Thrifty Cash
Thrifty Cash Hackathon app
This app was made during the 22 March - 22 May 2021 "Hardcore Entrepreneur" Hackathon. It is a mobile finance app with multiple functionalities among witch budget management, expenses and income tracking (with pie graphs and daily/monthly time stamps and alerts when exceeding a certain budget).
It also used to have a currency exchange api integrated, however it would seem it does not work anymore (may be updated in the future).
Unfortunately, this was a team challenge but my team did not come in contact with me during the challenge, meaning this was sadly done alone.

The app was made in a "hybrid" format. It was created using Android Studio by combining some "intermediate" Java code that was taught during the hackathon and a website made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
