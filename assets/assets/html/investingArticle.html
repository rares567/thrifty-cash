            <h1>What to invest and, more importantly, what not to invest money in</h1>
            <h2>1. High-fee mutual funds</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Like any beginner, you may be tempted to launch your investment portfolio with mutual funds.

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Reading that such funds are managed and administered by people with extensive experience in making investments, it would be natural to believe that you can achieve acceptable returns by investing with them.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;All true so far. But you need to be very careful about the fees and charges applied by those funds.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Most charge acceptable fees of between 0.1 % and 1 % of the portfolio per year. But there are also funds that charge 2 or maybe even 3 percentage points a year.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;This means that for a portfolio of 100,000 $, the first 2,000 or 3,000 $ of dividends or interest in a year will have to be paid to the fund manager.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Only the amounts earned afterwards will be yours.</p>
            <h2>2. Stocks</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;We can't tell you how many novice investors launch their investment portfolios out of a desire to speculate on certain stock market moments.

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;<b>Such investments should not even be considered by those who do not have extensive experience in the field</b> or who have not studied the phenomenon extremely well before entering the world of stocks.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;There are situations where, for various reasons, the value of certain shares has fallen sharply in a very short space of time, automatically generating massive losses of money.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The bad thing about stocks is that, depending on the case, the losses may not be limited to the amounts invested.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;There have been cases where inexperienced investors went in with $10,000, only to find themselves $100,000 in debt after just a few months.</p>
            <h2>2b. Stocks - useful questions</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Even if you've studied stock trading very carefully and experimented with demo accounts for years, you still wouldn't want to invest in them if you don't know how to answer the following questions:

                a) What does the company whose shares you are going to buy do for a living?
                b) How does the company in question make money?
                c) What is the PER or  P/E (price-to-earnings ratio)?
                d) What is the P/BV (price to book value) of a share?
                e) What is the net earnings per share?
                f) What is the DIVY (dividend yield) value?

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Share expectations from a conservative analysis over the next 5 or 10 years
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;If you don't know how to answer these questions, although there are other important ones, then what you are doing when you buy shares in the company is called "gambling" and not "investing".</p>
            <h2>3. Investing in your own home</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;You have no idea how many people answer the question "What should you invest money in?" with "In your own home, of course".

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;For decades now, the human brain has begun to perceive the term "investment" as something positive, while "spending" has taken on a slightly more negative note.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;That's why you will often hear the phrase "I invested in the renovation of my apartment" used around you, even though that money will never generate a profit from rents or an eventual sale.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;This means that the money has been spent and not invested.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Don't get us wrong, real estate investments can turn out to be very lucrative and profitable.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;But renovating your own home because you're bothered by the fact that the furniture is outdated or no longer in line with the latest trends cannot be considered a real estate investment.</p>
            <h2>4. Forex</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The Internet is full of ads like "A housewife can earn up to 5000 Dollars a month from forex".

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Unfortunately, as you've probably figured out for yourself, these ads are as fake as it gets and have no purpose other than to promote trading services and apps.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;It is true, that through Forex (name that comes from the derivation of the term FOReign EXchange) there is money to be made, or even a lot of money.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;But to get there takes years of intense study of the phenomenon and a lot of common sense. Not to mention an uncommon cool head and a total apathy for the funds invested.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;And all this can only be developed through demo accounts. Otherwise, you're just gambling, and like everything else in life, luck can't help you forever.</p>
            <h2>5. Commodity Exchange</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Building materials, grains, oil, various minerals are just some of the goods that can be traded through the Commodities Exchange.

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Even though, in theory, trading such goods is as simple as it gets - buy low and sell high, there are a lot of risks involved when you decide to add this form of investment to your portfolio.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Successful companies in the industry invest millions of dollars annually just to purchase and manage software that observes and analyzes the price of goods so they can know when it's right to buy and when to sell certain commodities.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;At the same time, the big players have the advantage of being able to negotiate from a position of strength, entering huge quantities of goods into a deal, incomparable to what a private investor could afford to buy.</p>
            <h2>6. Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;It's impossible that you haven't heard about last year's Bitcoin craze, which appreciated in 12 months by more than 300%.

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The problem is that the cryptocurrency market, no matter which currency you're interested in, is extremely risky and volatile.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;From our own experience we can tell you that we have been tracking Etherium for more than a year and it is not uncommon for the currency to lose up to 15% or even 20% in the course of a day.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;In other words, if you bought Etherium for $ 10,000, in just 24 hours you could lose $ 2,000 - a huge amount, we think.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;On the other hand, there may be a scenario where the currency appreciates just as much.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;There are real chances to make money from cryptocurrencies, but such placements should be made very carefully and only with the funds you don't need.</p>
            <h2>7. Collectibles</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The collectibles market varies greatly, depending on the economic state of the country you are in.

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;In times of crisis, people are more reluctant to invest money in such things, while in an economic boom art objects, expensive wines, stamps, etc. are increasingly sought after.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;But if you're not a connoisseur, chances are you're more likely going to lose money rather than make money. You need to be able to value an object correctly and, what's more, to know whether or not it's real.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Then, you will sometimes have to wait for years before you find someone interested in buying the good you are offering for sale.</p>
            <h2>8. Jewellery</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Many people are under the impression that if they buy jewellery, they are actually investing in gold. But such thinking is as false as it gets.

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The cost of a piece of jewellery includes not only the precious metal, but also the workmanship of the craftsman who finished and set the metal.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Not to mention that if you buy a ring, say, from a well-known brand, you will automatically pay a cost generated by that brand.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Investing in gold is fine and can generate profits for those who pursue the phenomenon, but jewellery never does. They have only an aesthetic role and nothing more.</p>
            <h2>9. Investing in yourself like trips or small relaxations</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;We often hear the line "Invest in yourself" used by travel agents or spas.

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Of course, they do it because it sounds much better than saying "Spend on yourself", again reminding us how the human brain perceives these two terms.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The idea of investing in yourself is a very good one and can only have a positive role. Whether you go to various courses, seminars, buy books or enroll in a new college, all of these actions can be seen as investments.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Yes, you spend some money, but over time you also expect to gain from the knowledge you acquire.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;But going on an all-inclusive trip to Greece or getting a new car just because it's nicer than your old one is not an investment.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;OK, they make your life better and help you relax, which is good, but they should never be compared to real investments that help you grow financially.</p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;We're not saying that if you're wondering what to invest money in, some of the above options may not be viable solutions.

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;But to be able to use them properly, you first need to study them as much as you can and find out which option suits you.
                
                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Although the approach of the article was a little different, we hope that it has managed to open your eyes a little to some ideas that you should not invest money in without a thorough study of the phenomenon first.</p>
