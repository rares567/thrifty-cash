        <h1>Passive income. What it is and how to evaluate the potential of any idea (incl. 17 examples)</h1>
        <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;This article explains what passive income is and how we can analyse any idea that seems to have the potential to generate passive income.

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;In addition, we will look at 17 feasible examples of how to generate passive income.
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;And the best part:
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;You'll know what criteria to quickly apply to assess the potential (and implications) of any passive income idea from now on.
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Cool, let's dive right in!</p>

        <h1>Passive Income. Definition</h1>
        <p><b>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;What does passive income actually mean?</b><br>
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Passive income is financial gain that requires little effort to earn money and maintains its source of earnings. It's when you still get paid after your work is done.
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;It can include royalties from books, online courses, investments in financial instruments, real estate investments or investments in businesses where you don't have to be present to earn money.
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;However, the idea of passive income is highly interpretable in reality.
            
            <b>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Why?</b><br>
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Because the time, money and effort invested to generate this "passive income" varies widely from one source of income to another. As well as how we each value this investment in terms of effort, money and time.
            
            <b>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Are there any easy passive income ideas?</b><br>
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Many ideas with the potential to generate passive income initially involve varying amounts of time, money, risk-taking and expertise. Success is not guaranteed. Other passive income generating ideas, in terms of difficulty in implementation, are effectively no-brainers. Just as some are downright childish but not necessarily ineffective.
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Either way, there are ideas for everyone, every possibility, every appetite for risk, available time, resources or knowledge.
            
            <b>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;How do I choose a passive income idea that's right for me?</b><br>
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;By ranking it. In relation to other ideas but also in terms of risks, benefits and other criteria. 
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;You'll see below how, by looking to diversify my income, I've rated several ideas with passive income potential. Some of them I have actually tested and for others I have only done some research (as best I could) in order to position them as close as possible to what might happen in reality.
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The idea is to make them useful to you as well as to offer insight into potential risks, potential benefits plus investment projections in knowledge, time and money.</p>

        <h1>How to assess the potential of various passive income ideas</h1>
        <p>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;In my research, reality shows me that sources of absolutely passive income are extremely scarce. Most are in a grey area (at least for a while) between active and passive income. On an active income - passive income spectrum some ideas may initially generate only active income and then progressively move to passive income, others may immediately generate passive income and some will remain forever somewhere between the two extremes.

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Taking into account the differences between theory (or hearsay) and reality, for a more abstract picture the following practical examples have been categorised by risk, profit, learning curve (skill), initial and subsequent expenditure and initial and subsequent involvement.
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The rating range was set from 0 to 5.
            
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The benchmark for evaluating these criteria is:

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;<b>Risk</b>: zero. Maximum score is 5

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;<b>Profitability potential</b>: very high. Maximum score is 5

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;<b>Learning curve</b>: none. Virtually anyone would know what to do. Maximum score is 5

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;<b>Initial expenses</b>: zero (other than the investment itself; taxes, fees, etc.). Maximum score is 5

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;<b>Subsequent expenses</b>: zero. Maximum score is 5

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;<b>Initial involvement</b>: minimum. Maximum score is 5

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;<b>Subsequent involvement</b>: minimum. Maximum score is 5
        
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;The lower the risk, the greater the potential profitability and the lesser the time commitment, money or other kind of effort now or later, the closer that source of income comes to the idea of absolutely passive income.

            <b>&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;How reliable are these assessments?</b><br>
            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Your assessments may be different from mine because there are many peculiarities that can be taken into account. In fact, I even ask you to analyze each of these ideas using your own value judgments and the information you have or can obtain. But I consider the evaluation criteria valid to be used in the analysis of any idea with the potential to generate passive income.

            &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;Some of the examples I will present are very easy to implement, others on the contrary. None of the ideas will make you rich overnight. But if you create at least 1-2 sources of passive income (in addition to your active income - usually your salary) things could be better for you financially within a few years.</p>

                &#8287;&#8287;&#8287;&#8287;In recent years, many people have had interesting gains from creating videos on YouTube. They've gotten tens of thousands - hundreds of thousands - millions of views, put ads on their videos and made a lot of money. If you know you have something interesting to convey (and in as original a way as possible) this way is definitely a form of passive income that can put money in your bank account every time someone watches your video. The estimated average payout on YouTube is $3 per 1000 views. I say average because payouts are determined by the number of views but also by the clicks the ad receives, as well as the quality of the ad, the length of the video and more. No one seems to know how much Google can actually pay you for your clips.

Mutual funds are not traded on stock exchanges and can only be accessed through an investment management company. But beware of annual management fees. They can ruin your profits over the years.

You share the income, but you just generated passive income (because your involvement was minimal) and they, active income.
